- Ch. 9: "Costs of Goods Sold: For Warren The Lower The Better"
  Lower cost of goods sold or cost of revenue may indicate a better durable competitive advantage.
  Sum of Cost of Goods may include raw material costs and labor to create the goods, but it is worth investigating
  exactly how they are calculated to get an idea of how management views the business. 
  However as a lone number, it does not offer much in the way of assuring that durability. It is essential
  in determining the gross profit of the business though.
  
- Ch. 10: "Gross Profit/Gross Profit Margin: Key Numbers For Warren In His Search For Long-Term Gold"
  Gross profit is total revenue minus the cost of goods sold. The calculation doesn't include categories like
  sales and administrative costs, depreciation and interest costs. Again, by itself, the metric doesn't elucidate much.
  However, it can be used to create a ratio of Gross Profit to Total Revenue known as the Gross Profit Margin (GPM).
  
  Gross Profit / Total Revenue = Gross Profit Margin
  (Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Total Revenue = Gross Profit Margin
  
  Companies that have excellent long-term economics working in their favor tend to have consistently higher gross profit margins than those that don't. 
  Total revenue is the amount of money that the company acquired during the given period. A higher gross profit margin indicates a higher efficiency because 
  it must mean that Cost of Goods Sold is low or that the company's durable competitive allows it to price products in excess of its Costs of Goods Sold. 
  Lower prices are employed by companies with no durable competitive advantage in a struggle to remain competitive, but they ultimately mean lower revenue
  and worse profit margins. A positive gross profit margin indicates that Total Revenue > Cost of Goods Sold. 
  
  Simple example to illustrate point made above:
  Company A: Total Revenue - 7, Cost of Goods Sold - 2
  Company B: Total Revenue - 4, Cost of Goods Sold - 2
  
  GPM_A = (7 - 2) / 7 = 5/7
  GPM_B = (4 - 2) / 2 = 1/2
  
  GPM_A > GPM_B
  
  Tech industry is mentioned to be a bit of an outlier here, along with Warren's skepticism in investing in it. Example given that MSFT has a GPM of 79% while AAPL 
  has 33%, indicating that MSFT produces better economics selling OS than AAPL does selling hardware and services. 
  Take with grain of salt given that book was published in 2007. 
  
  Examples given of high GPM are all > 50%.
  Examples given of low GPM are all < 25%.
  
  Rule of Thumb Given:
  GPM > 40% - Some sort of competitive advantage
  GPM < 40% - Companies in highly competitive industry; competition hurting profit margins (exceptions possible)
  GPM < 20% - Fiercely competitive; no one company can establish an advantage
  
  "Durable" emphasized, so important to track GPM over the course of 10 years to ensure it is maintained as a constant or positive trajectory.
  
- Ch. 11: "Operating Expenses: Where Warren Keeps A Careful Eye"
  
  Total Operating Expenses = R&D + Selling & Admin Costs + Depreciation + Amoritization + Restructuring & Impairment Charges + Other (Non-operating, non-recurring catch-all)
  Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses = Operating Profit or Loss
  
- Ch. 12: "Selling, General, And Administrative Expenses"
  Selling, General & Adminstrative (SGA) Expenses are composed of direct and indirect selling expenses and all general and administrative expenses incurred during given
  accounting period. Management salaries, advertising, travel costs, legal fees, commissions, payroll costs, etc. 
  
  SGA as a percentage of GPM varies greatly with companies that can be identified to have a durable competitive advantage.
