- Ch. 9: "Costs of Goods Sold: For Warren The Lower The Better"
  Lower cost of goods sold or cost of revenue may indicate a better durable competitive advantage.
  Sum of Cost of Goods may include raw material costs and labor to create the goods, but it is worth investigating
  exactly how they are calculated to get an idea of how management views the business. 
  However as a lone number, it does not offer much in the way of assuring that durability. It is essential
  in determining the gross profit of the business though.
  
- Ch. 10: "Gross Profit/Gross Profit Margin: Key Numbers For Warren In His Search For Long-Term Gold"
  Gross profit is total revenue minus the cost of goods sold. The calculation doesn't include categories like
  sales and administrative costs, depreciation and interest costs. Again, by itself, the metric doesn't elucidate much.
  However, it can be used to create a ratio of Gross Profit to Total Revenue known as the Gross Profit Margin (GPM).
  
  Gross Profit / Total Revenue = Gross Profit Margin
  (Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Total Revenue = Gross Profit Margin
  
  Companies that have excellent long-term economics working in their favor tend to have consistently higher gross profit margins than those that don't. 
  Total revenue is the amount of money that the company acquired during the given period. A higher gross profit margin indicates a higher efficiency because 
  it must mean that Cost of Goods Sold is low or that the company's durable competitive allows it to price products in excess of its Costs of Goods Sold. 
  Lower prices are employed by companies with no durable competitive advantage in a struggle to remain competitive, but they ultimately mean lower revenue
  and worse profit margins. A positive gross profit margin indicates that Total Revenue > Cost of Goods Sold. 
  
  Simple example to illustrate point made above:
  Company A: Total Revenue - 7, Cost of Goods Sold - 2
  Company B: Total Revenue - 4, Cost of Goods Sold - 2
  
  GPM_A = (7 - 2) / 7 = 5/7
  GPM_B = (4 - 2) / 2 = 1/2
  
  GPM_A > GPM_B
  
  Tech industry is mentioned to be a bit of an outlier here, along with Warren's skepticism in investing in it. Example given that MSFT has a GPM of 79% while AAPL 
  has 33%, indicating that MSFT produces better economics selling OS than AAPL does selling hardware and services. 
  Take with grain of salt given that book was published in 2007. 
  
  Examples given of high GPM are all > 50%.
  Examples given of low GPM are all < 25%.
  
  Rule of Thumb Given:
  GPM > 40% - Some sort of competitive advantage
  GPM < 40% - Companies in highly competitive industry; competition hurting profit margins (exceptions possible)
  GPM < 20% - Fiercely competitive; no one company can establish an advantage
  
  "Durable" emphasized, so important to track GPM over the course of 10 years to ensure it is maintained as a constant or positive trajectory.
  
- Ch. 11: "Operating Expenses: Where Warren Keeps A Careful Eye"
  
  Total Operating Expenses = R&D + Selling & Admin Costs + Depreciation + Amoritization + Restructuring & Impairment Charges + Other (Non-operating, non-recurring catch-all)
  Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses = Operating Profit or Loss
  
- Ch. 12: "Selling, General, And Administrative Expenses"
  Selling, General & Adminstrative (SGA) Expenses are composed of direct and indirect selling expenses and all general and administrative expenses incurred during given
  accounting period. Management salaries, advertising, travel costs, legal fees, commissions, payroll costs, etc. 
  
  SGA as a percentage of GPM varies greatly in companies that can be identified to have a durable competitive advantage, seemingly largely dependent on the industry their in.
  Examples given are Coca Cola with 59% of SGA/GPM, Moody's with 25% and Proctor & Gamble at 61%. The distinction that is made is that these companies spend this figure
  consistently year-to-year. Companies suffering from intense competition are required to vary their SGA costs significantly. GM has increased SGA/GPM from 28% to 83% in 5 years
  and Ford has increased theirs from 89% to 780% over the same time frame. Sales decreased, revenue fell, SGA stayed the same is the likely cause.
  
  Bottom-line: The lower the SGA costs and SGA/GPM the better, especially if they can stay consistently low. < 30% is best, but it is common for companies with DCA to be 30% -
  80%. Repeptitive flarings of 100% is a bad sign. Likewise, low-med SGA/GPM companies may be plauged with high R&D, capital expenditures, and/or interest expsense on debt load. 
  Necessary to exclude companies with consistently high SGA/GPM percentages, but also necessary to conditionally include those with lower values in context of their other metrics
  such as R&D, capital expenditures and interest expense/high debt. 
  
- Ch. 13: "Research And Development: Why Warren Stays Away From It"
  Mentioned to be particularly important. A patent or some technological advancement can masquerade as a DCA, which in fact not make it durable but vulnerable. The threat of it
  being made obsolete by new advancements is ever-present. High R&D spending also carries over into SGA increases due to associated rework of selling and administrative costs
  that comes with new products and services. The book offers no quantitative guidance on assessing R&D costs but does present some examples, such as Intel needing to spend 30%
  of Gross Profit on R&D consistently to remain competitive, along with even larger figures for pharmaceutical companies. Warren's rule is said to be: companies that have to
  spend heavily on R&D have an inherent flaw in their competitive advantage that will always put their long-term economics at risk, which means they are not a sure thing.
  Coca Cola and Moody's given as an example of companies that spend little on R&D, if nothing at all. 
  
  For programming, two approaches can be taken:
  1) Set R&D/GP < 5%, indicating very tiny spending on R&D, and check it for a consistent time frame.
  2) Be more liberal and use Intel's 30% R&D/GP example as a benchmark, making the program screen for consistent R&D/GP percentage below 25%. Would be wise to do some research
  into current figures to see how they compare to 2007.
  
  In either approach, it will be necessary to screen outputs for the industries they are in and look at if their competitive advantage may be coming from patents or 
  technology that could be made obsolete short-term (5 years) by other advancements.
