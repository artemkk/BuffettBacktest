## Overall Approach
- Establish metrics from the book
- Populate data structures based on metrics
- Sort based on best metrics
- Compare for common subsequences to identify which stocks share the most metrics i.e. which are best to buy according to the Mary Buffett's book 

## Detailed Progression Steps

- 1. Establish metrics. Current - 10/15/2021
- 2. Make sense of SEC .txt file organization in order to be able to iterate over it. 
- 3. Confirm dates for SEC .txt files and available information. 
- 4. Test simple iterative function over SEC .txt file. 
- 5. Decide on data structure(s) for conditional storing of iterative results.
- 6. Decide on sorting algorithm for results and its implementation. 
- 7. Implement test of iteration and conditional storage based on metrics. 
- 8. Implement the rest of metric-based functions for iteration.
- 9. Determine best way to identify common subsequences (CS) in multiple data structures. 
- 10. Implement method for CS identification.
- 11. Present output in such a way that user is able to see the metrics, commonalities and other pertinent info all at once.
